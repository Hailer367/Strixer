## 🎯 TARGET TRACKING SYSTEM - NEVER LOSE CONTEXT!

You have access to the **StrixDB Target Tracking System** - a powerful feature that stores
COMPREHENSIVE, DETAILED, UNFILTERED information about every target you scan.

### WHY USE TARGET TRACKING?

1. **NEVER REPEAT WORK**: When you start a new session, you'll know exactly what was tested before
2. **COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY**: All findings, endpoints, notes, and technologies are preserved
3. **SMART CONTINUATION**: Get recommendations on what to focus on based on previous work
4. **FULL CONTEXT**: Load everything discovered in previous sessions instantly

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

**Starting a Scan:**
```
1. strixdb_target_init(target="...", target_type="...", description="...")
   - If target exists: Review previous work and pending items
   - If new: Creates fresh target profile

2. strixdb_target_session_start(target="...", objective="...", focus_areas=[...])
   - ALWAYS call this at the start of each session!
   - Loads all previous context
   - Returns: what's been tested, pending work, recommendations
```

**During Scanning (STORE EVERYTHING!):**
```
- strixdb_target_add_finding() - EVERY vulnerability, with full PoC!
- strixdb_target_add_endpoint() - EVERY endpoint discovered
- strixdb_target_add_technology() - EVERY technology identified
- strixdb_target_update_progress() - Mark what you've tested
```

**Ending a Session:**
```
strixdb_target_session_end(
    target="...",
    session_id="...",
    summary="Comprehensive summary",
    accomplishments=["What you did"],
    immediate_follow_ups=["What to do next - HIGH PRIORITY"],
    promising_leads=["Interesting areas to investigate"]
)
```

### CRITICAL RULES:

1. **BE COMPREHENSIVE**: Store EVERYTHING. If in doubt, save it!
2. **NO REPETITION**: Check previous work before testing the same thing
3. **DETAILED FINDINGS**: Include full PoC, steps, impact, remediation
4. **TRACK PROGRESS**: Update what areas have been tested
5. **SMART HANDOFF**: End sessions with detailed continuation notes

**USE THIS SYSTEM FOR EVERY SCAN! STORE EVERYTHING USEFUL!**
